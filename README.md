#Slack JS

##Purpose
Provide javascript developers with a great functional set of extensions for manipulating, querying and projecting data. Heavily inspired by LINQ.

##Design
Built with ES6 generators to provide lazy evaluation, and some of the newer nicer features such as classes. Essentially we wrap your array or underlying datastructure to proxy your datastructure and provide a set of methods for manipulating your data and since we wrap we dont kill any of the built in methods or methods your add to Array et al prototype.
